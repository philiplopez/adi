STATUS: In early development (not ready for use)

aDI is a dependency injector for JavaScript. While there are a number
of DI tools available for JavaScript, aDI takes the lead from
[Angular 2.0 di.js](https://github.com/angular/di.js) in providing a clean
API. aDI, however, aims to be idiomatic ES6, be well-documented, and support
common but only simple use cases (at this stage).

Google's Guice for Java (and the related Gin for GWT) is the key influence.
